# Country codes in CSS

## Introduction
With the included stylesheet and sprite image (based on famfamfam's flag icons - http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/), it's easy to automatically show the correct flag in front of any name or country anywhere on your site. Long lists load faster due to the use of a sprite image.

## Country list
The list of world countries is based on the list of ISO 3166 codes for countries in existence at the time of last update:

The official list is constantly receiving updates, so the list might not be 100% accurate.
